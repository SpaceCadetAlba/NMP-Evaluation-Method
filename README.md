# NMP Evaluation Method

A DAW-based approach to network music performance audio system evaluation

# Summary

This repo contains the required resource to conduct immersive audio rendering system evaluations in Network Music Performance (NMP) contexts.

The presented workflow uses:

- a DAW (Reaper) to host audio rendering processes and record audio for synchrony analysis.
- an NMP application (Jacktrip) to stream audio between endpoints.
- A MATLAB control application, which controls test sequences across endpoints, and provides participant user interface (for input of personal data and Quality of Experience questionnaire item rating).

An example has been prepared such that modification and repurposing of the workflow for further immersive audio rendering system evaluations requires only editing of:

- Worksheet files (.xlsx)
- Batch files (.bat)
- DAW (Reaper) sessions (.rpp)

Setup and Usage Guidance Notes are included.
These notes may be found in the "Guides" directory.

The example considers:

- Windows OS
- LAN deployment
- 2 performer endpoints
- 1 optional researcher 'control room' endpoint
